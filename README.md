## Unlock the Potential of Collaboration

### üöÄ **Join Us for an Unforgettable Week of Learning, Building, and Networking**

This repository is for the PSE Hacker House at ETHCC 2024. It serves as the central hub for hackers to submit their projects, collaborate on code, and access resources related to the event. The Hacker House brings together developers from around the world to innovate, collaborate, and build projects focused on privacy, scaling, and Ethereum technologies. Throughout the week, participants will work on cutting-edge projects, attend workshops, and network with like-minded individuals.

**When & Where:**  
**üìÖ** July 1st - 7th, 2024  
**üìç** Brussels, Belgium (A Week Before ETHCC)

## **About the Project / Hacker House**

The PSE Hacker House is a week-long event designed to foster innovation and collaboration in the Ethereum community. Hosted by Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE), the Hacker House provides an immersive environment where developers can focus on building projects that leverage advanced cryptographic techniques and scalable solutions. Participants will have the opportunity to work alongside experienced mentors, gain insights into their tools, and showcase their work in a demo day at the end of the week.

### **Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE)**

PSE is a multidisciplinary team supported by the Ethereum Foundation. The team explores new use cases for zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic primitives, focusing on privacy and scalability solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem. PSE's projects aim to enhance the security, privacy, and usability of decentralized applications, contributing to the broader vision of a more secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure.

## **What to Expect?**

- **Attendees:** 10 hackers from all over the world, plus 5-7 PSE mentors on-site.
- **Program Structure:** Work in teams to hack and develop projects, with a demo day on the final day. Throughout the week, there will be various talks and workshops to support your development.
- **Potential Grants:** If mentors see potential in your work, we could offer grants to support your continued efforts.
- **Best Arrival Time:** 10am-12pm on July 1st.

**Project Description:**

üÖ∞Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏è¬Æ is a recovery module allowing to recover "sub" Safes through a "master" Safe without any traceable link - maintaining privacy.

The Safe module hosts a custom verifier which facilitates recovery action authorization through the "master" Safe in zero-knowledge.

At the core of AAAR lies a ZK circuit capable of verifying EIP-1186 proofs. This primitive enables an array of use cases, such as anonymous Safe signers and proofs of ownership.

We have been experimenting with various proof systems to come up with an implementation with acceptable memory consumption and speed so that they would be applicable in real-world use cases where computation must be near-real-time and client-side. We had experimented with SP1, during the hacker house we developed a MVP built with Halo2, still that implementation is not very performant, that's why we are currently building an alternative circuit implementation with Noir.

**Technical Stack:**

- Noir
- (Halo2, halo2-lib, axiom-eth)
- Rhinestone's ModuleKit
- ERC7579
- WASM

**Project Goals:**

- Provide a portable (i.e. WASM) implementation of an EIP-1186-verifying-zk-circuit prover alongside JS/TS and Rust adapters
- Publish an AAAR Safe module for master-sub recovery
